#### How much is it? Is it free?

Alpha  builds will always be free. I'd like to move to store fronts such as Steam or IndieGameStand eventually, in which case that'll be re-evaluated.

#### How do I get it?

Right here, when it's ready. There'll be a link on top. Unsure where else you can get it now, I'm looking at options for distribution.

#### Is it open source?

The source code is there for you to look at. The world needs more open source games that people can look at. I wish I'd had more games that were similar to what I wanted to make that I could still look at. Feel free to fork this or do things with it, in accordance with the license. 

The assets aren't all open/free, though, so be careful with that!

#### What's planned right now?

There's a link on top called Huboard; that has all of the things I've considered so far. Go look!

#### Can you add X?

Maybe! Let me know! Use the feedback on this website, send me a tweet, however you want to reach out. I'm happy to look at what you're interested in and listen!

#### Can I add X?

Sure! Please do. You can even let me know! I've tried to keep the game open enough to 

#### How do I talk to you?

That's a good question. I'm not sure what the best way to get feedback is, but for now, just tweet at me I suppose. I'll get something more official up on this site at some point, but that's a good start.

#### Development's not progressing quickly enough!

Yup. I have a full-time job that's not this. This happens in my spare time, which is itself pulled in many directions.

#### This is broken!

Yep! It's still in development. Send me feedback and let me know, or check the backlog on Huboard or GitHub to see if I already know about it.

#### Why are you making this?

I'm making this game because I want to play it. If that doesn't happen to be a game you want, then I'm sorry. Feel free to tell me so (respectfully), and I'll definitely listen to you. But the bottom line for decision making is "will I play this?", not "will other people play this or pay for this?"

#### When are updates?

I plan on trying to release an update once per month, for the foreseeable future. Realistically, that will eventually come to an end.
