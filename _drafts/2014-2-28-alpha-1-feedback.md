### new ideas
- cooking profession seemed exciting to people
- cute ideas with blackberry + random item. Berrymancer? jam + spear, etc.

### new improvements
- rewards for contracts aren't immediately obvious. can popup over the screen?
- Rent notification of being deducted. More emphasis when a day changes.
- shipment not immediately obvious that you link to the contracts
- contracts - tried to click/interact with it. No indication that it's different than the drag screens
- bigger maps for exploration!
- slow down generation, or speed it up. Make it variable I guess. Sam could basically barely keep up. Didn't feel like a ton of progress. Use this as a pacing mechanic I guess.

### prioritize known stuff
- that 'duplicate reward' bug was noticable
- flow for crafting/shipping is clunky
- time display is indeed confusing. Thought it was hours remaining. Not a bad idea...
- more items/recipes asap
- scale the icons soon, hard to play when tiny.

### bugs 
- BUG - leaving map and come back, things weren't generating. I don't think a day had yet passed
- BUG - crash after day changed while on a inventory screen

### uncategorized
- Currency -> noncents?
- sound feedback is good.
- good 'cookie' game, very relaxed.
- books for scribe is good idea if recipes remain hidden
- test on different platforms to see resolution issues earlier
