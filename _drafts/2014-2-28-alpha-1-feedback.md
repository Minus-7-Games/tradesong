title: Feedback dump from Alpha 1 night.
---

- contracts - tried to click/interact with it. No indication that it's different than the drag screens
- scale the icons omg
- shipment not immediately obvious that you link to the contracts
- BUG - leaving map and come back, things weren't generating. I don't think a day had yet passed
- more items/recipes asap
- cute ideas with blackberry + random item. Berrymancer? jam + spear, etc.
- Rent notification of being deducted. More emphasis when a day changes.
- BUG - crash after day changed while on a inventory screen
- time display is indeed confusing. Thought it was hours remaining. Not a bad idea...
- Currency -> noncents?
- cooking profession seemed exciting to people
- that 'duplicate reward' bug was noticable
- rewards for contracts aren't immediately obvious. can popup over the screen?
- flow for crafting/shipping is clunky
- books for scribe is good idea if recipes remain hidden
- bigger maps for exploration!
- good 'cookie' game, very relaxed.
- sound feedback is good.
- slow down generation, or speed it up. Make it variable I guess. Sam could basically barely keep up. Didn't feel like a ton of progress. Use this as a pacing mechanic I guess.
