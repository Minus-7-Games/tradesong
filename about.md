## What is Tradesong?

Tradesong is a game about being an entrepreneur in a fantasy world. You'll leave the fighting to the brutes and the maniacs while turning a profit off of their labors. Support your kingdom by venturing into the Wyld to collect resources, turn those raw materials in to in-demand goods and perfect your craft. Just be mindful not to fall in to debt while doing so!

## Learn and grow as a player, not as a character sheet.

There's no levels and no restrictions in Tradesong; all the items are there to be found and crafted. Trade to survive and grow your empire of business.
